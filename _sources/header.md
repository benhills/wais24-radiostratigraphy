Englacial layers are a product of historic accumulation and are reshaped by ice deformation. Hence, radio-echo sounding (RES), which can resolve englacial layering, has gained broad adoption as an observational tool to infer ice age and/or ice dynamics from ice stratigraphy. However, the resolved stratigraphy in radar images is not always continuous, which then prevents the conventional interpretation of ice-sheet processes and history. For example, stratigraphy can be disrupted by fractures, unconformities, or power losses associated with either birefringence or steeply dipping layers. Rather than perceiving the stratigraphic disruptions as a data obstruction, we aim to investigate the underlying processes that drive disruptions and then interpret them as a signal, leveraging them to interpret ice properties and physical processes. Here, we focus on two types of layer disruptions, birefringent and layer-dipping losses. Birefringent losses are driven by anisotropy in the ice column, with a polarized wave rotating in and out of view of the receive antenna in a predictable way. Layer-dipping losses are generally a synthetic-aperture processing artifact, with destructive interference between traces. Since both anisotropy and layer dip are associated with the ice dynamic history, extracting them as a signal and comparing with the present-day surface velocity allows us to infer how ice flow has changed. We use these techniques along two flowline transects at Cook Glacier, which drains much of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, East Antarcticaâ€”a basin as large as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet potentially susceptible to similar marine ice-sheet instabilities.
